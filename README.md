Creating a simple food ordering site/app to prebook food. 
The chef should be able to easily edit the menu.
There will be no payment as it is only to prebook and
inform the chef how much they need to prepare for the customer.
I am going to use React, Firebase for admin/user and 
I will use Redux to learn more about state management
