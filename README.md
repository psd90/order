This is my first project (solo) since graduating from Northcoders.

I will be creating a simple food ordering site/app to prebook food. 
The chef should be able to easily edit the menu.
<br>
There will be no payment as it is only to prebook and
inform the chef how much they need to prepare for the customers.
<br>
I am going to use React, Firebase for admin and user verification
and storing the upto date menu.
I will use Redux to learn more about state management.
