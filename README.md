This is my first project since graduating from Northcoders.

I will be creating a food ordering application to prebook food. 
The admin should be able to easily edit the menu and a cut off date 
that people need to book before to ensure they get their order.
<br>
I am going to use React, Firebase for admin and user verification
and storing the upto date menu.
I will use Redux to learn more about state management.
<br>
The admin should be able to see total numbers for individual menu items to prepare and then individual orders for packagining.
