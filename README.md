This is my first project
since graduating from Northcoders.

I will be creating a food ordering 
application to prebook food.

I am going to use React. 
I will also use Firebase for admin and user 
verification and storing menu.

I will use Redux for state management.


The admin should be able to easily 
edit the menu and a cut off date 
that users will need to order before.


The admin should be able to see total 
numbers for individual menu items to 
prepare and then individual orders 
for packaging.
