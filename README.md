This is my first project
<br>
since graduating from Northcoders.

I will be creating a food ordering <br>
application to prebook food.

I am going to use React. 
I will also use Firebase <br>for admin and user <br>
verification and storing menu.

I will use Redux for state management.


The admin should be able to easily <br>
edit the menu and a cut off date <br>
that users will need to order before.


The admin should be able to see total <br>
numbers for individual menu items to <br>
prepare and then individual orders <br>
for packaging.
